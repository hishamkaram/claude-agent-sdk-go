# Changelog

All notable changes to the Claude Agent SDK for Go are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Real-CLI integration test suite under `tests/integration_*_test.go`,
  gated by the `integration` Go build tag. Covers every public `Client`
  method, the `sessions` package API, all 23 `HookEvent` constants, the
  MCP lifecycle, cross-cutting concurrency, and a CLI-flag drift detector.
  38 passing, 0 failing against a live CLI.
- `tests/coverage_matrix.md` documenting per-method status.
- `tests/fixtures/` placeholder directory for wire-shape probe baselines.
- `.github/workflows/integration.yml` — nightly workflow that runs the
  integration suite against `secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. Manual dispatch
  supports `run_turns` and `stress` inputs.
- `make test-integration-quota` Makefile target for the full suite
  including turn-driving tests (requires `CLAUDE_SDK_RUN_TURNS=1`).
- README "Integration testing" section documenting install, env gates,
  and local run recipes.

### Fixed
- `make test-integration` now correctly passes `-tags=integration` —
  previously the tagged suite compiled but never ran anywhere (latent).

### Known issues (surfaced by the new flag drift test)
- `WithAgentProgressSummaries` and `WithSubagentExecution` emit CLI flags
  (`--agent-progress-summaries`, `--subagent-execution`) that are not
  present in the CLI binary as of `claude-code-linux-x64` 0.5.1. Setting
  either option today causes `Connect()` to fail with an unknown-flag
  error. Tracked by `TestFlags_UnsupportedFlagsAreDocumented`.

## [0.2.9] - 2025-12-07

### Added
- Beta API feature support via `WithBetas()` and `WithBeta()` builder methods
- Support for Anthropic beta APIs like extended context windows (`context-1m-2025-08-07`)
- Pass beta feature flags to Claude Code CLI via `--betas` flag
- Comprehensive example demonstrating beta feature usage (`examples/with_betas/`)
- Extensive unit tests for betas functionality in both options and transport layers

### Details
- Implements feature parity with Python SDK v0.1.12+ for beta support
- Full CLI flag generation testing for `--betas` argument passing
- Supports multiple simultaneous beta features
- Method chaining support for fluent API usage
- Closes #23

## [0.2.2] - 2025-10-19

### Added
- Permission mode support with proper CLI flag passing
- Verbose logging option that can be enabled via `ClaudeAgentOptions.Verbose`
- System prompt support via `--system-prompt` flag to Claude CLI
- Permission prompt tool flag (`--permission-prompt-tool stdio`) for control protocol

### Fixed
- Control request handling for CLI-initiated requests without `request_id`
  - SDK now automatically generates request IDs for CLI-initiated control requests
  - Fixes permission callbacks that were failing silently
- Request ID parsing from top-level field in control_request messages
  - CLI sends `request_id` at top level, not inside request object
  - Fixes issue where control responses weren't matched to requests
  - Permission approvals are now properly recognized by CLI
- Client now properly passes options to transport layer
- Control protocol initialization and bidirectional communication

### Changed
- Enhanced control request logging for better debugging
- Updated `SubprocessCLITransport` to accept and use `ClaudeAgentOptions`
- Improved `SystemMessage` type with `RequestID` field for control protocol

## [0.1.0] - 2025-10-18
